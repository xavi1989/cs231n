#### Purpose  

This repo contains the files that I created when being a Teaching Assistant for CME 213 "Introduction to parallel computing using MPI, openMP, and CUDA" at Stanford University. 

The goal of the project was to create a CUDA program that would perform the connected component labeling on a GPU. The files of this repo were basically used to: 
* Check the correctness of the CUDA program.
* Have all scripts necessary to visualize the results and try the CUDA programs on various input images (namely it takes care of converting all the images to easily readable text files).

#### Example

Here is an example of what the program is doing:
 
![Input image](./example/input.png "Input")       ![Output image](./example/output.png "Output")

#### Overview of the repo

This repo is composed of the following parts: 
* A Python script **createinput.py** that converts an image to a file that can be read by the C++ program.
* A C++ program **main.cpp** that outputs a file containing the labels. Pixels in the same connected components are characterized by the fact that they share the same label. 
* A Python script **createimg.py** that takes as input the label file (created for instance by the C++ program) and outputs an image. Each color corresponds to a connected component.
* A C++ program **spiral.cpp** that can be used to generate arbitrarily large inputs. 
* Various shell scripts that can be used to create input files/run the connected components labeling program/create images from label files in batch mode.
* Some examples (see directory **img/** for the inputs and **results/** for the outputs).

The algorithm I used in my program is basically the Union-Find algorithm. I simplified the data structure so that it is minimal, without really caring about its efficiency.

#### Getting started (quick and dirty)

Here is what I suggest you do if you want to get a good idea of how you can use things:
* Create (if they do not exist already) 4 directories: **img/**, **results/**, **inputs/**, **outputs/**.
* Put a couple of images in the **img/** directory.
* Run   
`./generateInput.sh`  
This will create the text files representing the images (for the images in **img/**) in the **inputs/** directory.
* Run  
`./generateOutput.sh`  
This will create the text files containing the labels (for the input files in **inputs/**) in the **ouputs/** directory.
* Run  
 `./processAll.sh`  
 This will create the labeled images (for the images in **img/**) in the **results/** directory. 

#### Individual description of the files

Note that all files have comments at the top that explain what they contain and how they should be used. 

* **img/**: this folder contains sample images.
* **results/**: this folder contains the images produced by the algorithm.
* **main.cpp**: this file contains a serial implementation of the connected component labeling algorithm.
* **directions.h**: this file contains the inline functions used to find the indexes of the neighboring pixels.
* **imghelpers.h** and **imghelpers.cpp**: header and source files that contain the helper functions for image processing. This file can be used to read/write images using *ReadImgFromFile* and *WriteImgToFile*. To compare the output of another implementation (for instance a CUDA code) to the one produced by my solution, *CompareSolution* can be used; this function takes as arguments the names (include the correct path if the files are in a different directory) of the files to compare. 
* **createinput.py**: this Python script converts an image into a text file with the bits associated with each pixel (0 for black and 1 for white). The text file can then be easily read by the C++ code (using *ReadImgFromFile*). Please refer to the comments 
in the file for the usage of this script. 
* **createimg.py**: this Python script transforms the text file with the labels into an image; this allows visualization of the results. It takes as input a file formatted in the same way as the output of *WriteImgToFile*. 
* **helpers.py**: this file contains helper functions needed by the two other scripts. 
* **colors.py**: this file chooses appropriate colors in the RGB spectrum to be associated with each label in the output of the C++ program. This script is needed for the other scripts (createimg.py in particular). All the credits for this file go to [this site for the implementation](http://www.8bitrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/colorgen.txt) and [this thread for some ideas I found useful](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4296249/how-do-i-convert-a-hex-triplet-to-an-rgb-tuple-and-back).
* **generateInput.sh**: create text files representing the images. Does this for all the images in the **img/** directory. You need to have created a directory **inputs/** (this will be the directory that contain all the input files that you can then feed to the C++ code). 
* **generateOutput.sh**: takes all the input text files in the directory **inputs/** and produces the text files containing the labels in the directory **outputs/** (that you need to create before running the script). 
* **processAll.sh**: automates the whole process, namely, create text file representing the image, runs the algorithm to produce label file, and create the result image from the label file. By default, it runs both versions of the algorithm (4 and 8-connectivity) but you can easily comment the part that you do not need. 
* **processAll.sh**: runs in batch mode the algorithm on all images (calls **process.sh** basically) contained in the **img/** directory and outputs the images identifying the connected components in the **results/** directory (again, you will need to create this directory before running the script). 
* **spiral.cpp**: this program can be used to generate a spiral image (this is a tricky case for the algorithm).
* **Makefile**: a basic Makefile is provided so that the program can be used quickly. You should modify it especially if you just want to perform connected components labeling (turn in -O2 for instance so that it speeds things up ...).

#### Remarks  
* Project coded using g++ version 4.6, python 2.7 on Ubuntu 12.04.
* Requires Python 2.7 or higher with the [Image library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) set up. 
* If there are too many connected components, **colors.py** can go a bit crazy. 
* When using **createinput.py**, systematically use the -g flag (converts inputs to white and black images). If you have color images (or greyish images), you can adjust the threshold by using the -t flag (by default, the threshold is 128). Look at the shell scripts (<strong>process.sh</strong> for instance) to see exactly how the Python script is called.
